# NetMapper â€” Network Scanner (C + GTK3)

NetMapper scans your local IPv4 network to discover live hosts and displays information for each device:

- IP address
- Hostname (reverse DNS if available)
- MAC address (from `/proc/net/arp`)
- Open common TCP ports

It is written in C with a GTK3 GUI. The tool performs a ping sweep, reads the ARP table, and does a quick TCP connect scan.  

> **Disclaimer:** Run only on networks you own or have explicit permission to test. Misuse may be illegal.
